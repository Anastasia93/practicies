# practicies
some interesting self-education tasks implementations

# Include:

## -Online courses labs "Ninja JS"
Some labs, targeting to upgrade knowledge of JS basics)

## -Palindrosity
This programm is searching palindromes in your string.
### To check the the efficiency of the program:

Please enter to the text field any phrase containing palindromes, 
but it would be better to not use such simbols as a comma, period, dash, etc., if there are not a part of
palindrom but the way to sign punctuation, because this simbols and can destroy palindrome structure and made the programm
work uncorrectly.

Steps:

1. Open file `index.html`
2. Enter to the text area any palindrom phrase, or word or number. Or choose any 
of these one, copy and paste it into text area:
  - peeweep
  - Able was I ere I saw Elba
  - 12332112211

3. Push the button 'Test' to see the result of searching. In previous three cases you may see the next result under 
the phrase "Hey! We have found some palindromes in your string":

  - in 1st case:
    - peeweep
    - eewee
    - ewe
    - ee
    - ee

  - in 2nd case:
    - ablewasiereisawelba
    - blewasiereisawelb
    - lewasiereisawel
    - ewasiereisawe
    - wasiereisaw
    - asiereisa
    - siereis
    - ierei
    - ere

  - in 3rd case:
    - 123321
    - 112211
    - 2332
    - 2112
    - 1221
    - 33
    - 11
    - 22
    - 11

4. To search palindromes in another string, delete the previous and enter a new one.
